* Integration into masterfiles

** Download the policy and extract it into your masterfiles

#+begin_src sh
    MASTERFILES=/home/nickanderson/CFEngine/masterfiles
    wget https://github.com/nickanderson/CVE_2015_0235/archive/master.tar.gz -O /tmp/CVE_2015_0235.tar.gz
    tar --directory "$MASTERFILES/services" -zxvf /tmp/CVE_2015_0235.tar.gz
#+end_src

** The test exploit needs to be compiled.

#+begin_src sh
  cd $MASTERFILES/services/CVE_2015_2035/bins
  gcc GHOST.c -o GHOST_CVE-2015-0235
#+end_src

** Include the path to def.cf into inputs

#+begin_src cfengine
  body common control
  {
        inputs => { 
                    # Reports
                    @(cfengine_reports.inputs),
  
                    # If you want to activate this policy from autorun,
                    # then it needs to be included before autorun
                    # inptus.
                    "services/CVE_2015_0235/def.cf",
                    
                    # autorun system
                    @(services_autorun.inputs),
        };
  }
#+end_src

* Activate it in your policy (with autorun)

Create /masterfiles/services/autorun/CVE_2015_0235.cf with the following content.

#+begin_src cfengine
  bundle agent CVE_2015_0235
  {
    meta:
          # Make sure we get activated
          "tags" slist => { "autorun" };
        
    classes:
      any::
        # Enable the features we want
        "enable_CVE_2015_0235_inventory" expression => "any";
  
    methods:
          # Make sure that the control bundle has converged
        "CVE_2015_0235"
          usebundle => CVE_2015_0235_def_file_control,
          comment => "Activate each enabled policy";
        
      # Activate the features we want if they are enabled
      enable_CVE_2015_0235_inventory::
        "CVE_2015_0235"
          usebundle => CVE_2015_0235_inventory,
          comment => "We want to know where we are vulnerable";
  
    reports:
      DEBUG|DEBUG_CVE_2015_0235::
        "Activated: '$(this.bundle)' in '$(this.promise_filename)'";
  }
#+end_src
